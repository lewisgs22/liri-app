Liri is a command-line app that allows you to pass in four commands ("spotify-this-song", "movie-this", "concert-this", and "do-what-it-says")

Each command logs information related to your search in the console.

Use "spotify-this-song" followed by the song you are interested in to find the artist, album, and a url link to a song preview.

Use "movie-this" followed by the movie you want to find the year it was made, the actors/actresses in it, it's IMDB and rotten tomatoes rating, the language and country it was made in and a brief summary of the movie.

Use "concert-this" to search for and artist or band and you will see info about their next event, such as location and the date of the event.

Use "do-what-it-says" to call the "spotify-this-song" command and search for "I want it that way" by the Backstreet Boys.
